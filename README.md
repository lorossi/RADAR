# RADAR

*This makes less sense than many other things that I made.*

Quite a few months ago I decided I wanted to try making some videos by using text and typography. It took me a while to finish this one, but I managed to make it work and look (at least a little bit, I hope) interesting.

I wish I was one of those people who could easily pick a cool name for their projects but, as a quick tour around my GitHub profile wil show you, I'm really not. So, for the sake of simplicity I settled with *RADAR*.

That's pretty plain, but I started this animation with that idea in mind and I would love to give the project a coherent title, so here we go.

I do realize that this "radar" looks a little bit like Pacman. Maybe that's an idea for the next animation?

## Rendered output

Take a look at the output video on my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/lorossi97/), where you will also find a lot of other stuff that I made.

A few images and a choppy GIF are also a little bit lower on this page as well.
